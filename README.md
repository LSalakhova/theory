# ðŸ“š Testing Theory

On early stages of web and mobile testing I needed to apply the knowledge of the testing theory to determine the direction and strategy for the following stages of testing. 

Here I would like to showcase the application of testing theory I used for testing the webstore [Demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/) based on the Requirements (User Story ID) and the Webstore Mockup on Figma. All documentation is written in Russian language to demonstrate my fluency in using it.

1. [Testing methods, types and levels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KWTDez9xweNvRTERS_mUl4eEs0c1vACXWuRTJvxhgf8/edit?usp=sharing) - Based on the webstore description I determined the testing methods, levels and functional/non-functional types of testing that will be used for this project.

3. [Analysis of requirements and webstore mockup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sh8iG60d5kVHnhzEE__uBk8ARU2YSYHTjRcyFaxdjbo/edit?usp=sharing) - Analysis of the Requirements and Webstore Mockup to identify any inconsistencies and improve the quality and clarity of the Requirements. The following steps were performed during the analysis:

   * Requirements identification: collecting and brainstorming of all available requirements, including functional, non-functional, and business requirements.
   * Quality analysis: checking the requirements for completeness, correctness, monosemanticism and consistency.
   * Identification of any inconsistencies: finding and documenting any shortcomings, such as ambiguity, contradictory requirements, or incomplete feature descriptions.
   * Entering information into a table: creating a table that lists any found inconsistencies, their description, and recommendations for correction.
